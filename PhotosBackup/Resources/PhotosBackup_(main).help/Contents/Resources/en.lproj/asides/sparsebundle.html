<p>The <code>sparsebundle</code> format is a disk image format created by Apple. It can be stored on most file systems, and can grow in size up to a maximum size specified at creation. Thus, a 10GB sparsebundle will initially take up far less space on disk.
The <code>sparsebundle</code> itself takes the form of an Apple <code>package</code> - a folder that appears as a single file on Mac systems (like applications do). It will appear as a folder on non-Apple operating systems - do not modify its internals. In order to access the Photos Library backed up within, you must mount the <code>sparsebundle</code> as a disk using the Finder or other Mac utilities.</p>
